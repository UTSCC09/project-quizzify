### Top 5 Technical Challenges
> Understand that a challenge is something new that you have to learn or figure out. Anything we have already covered in class cannot be considered as a challenge. Making the application work and deploying it is not a challenge but a project requirement.

1. **Real-time Synchronization**: Utilize web sockets to ensure all participants see all actions at the same time (ex. questions/answers, updated leaderboards, real-time, timer) + handle effects of possible network latency
2. **Scalability**: Ensure the web application can handle a large number of concurrent playing users, (notably large quiz sessions)
3. **3rd-party Services**: Integrate 3rd party services such as Twilio SendGrid to send email notifications 
4. **3rd-party Authorization**: Utilize Auth0 to use Google accounts for our user authorization (JWT) + profiles
5. **Responsive and Interactive UI**: Crafting a user interface that is intuitive, responsive across all device types, and able to handle various media formats without lag or distortion.
